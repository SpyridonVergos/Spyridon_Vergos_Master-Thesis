The fields of big data analysis and deep learning are developing fast
recently mainly due to the vast availability of data sets online and the
unpreceded cheap computational power of cloud services. LSTM
Neural Networks is a specialized function approximator for time-series
problems. It involves memory neurons that can overcome the training
problems faced by classical Recurrent Neural Networks with very deep
architectures. In this Thesis, we use an LSTM Neural Network to test the
Efficient Market Hypothesis introduced by Eugene Fama by attempting
to forecast the movement of the Greek Index Future FTSE/ATHEX Large
Cap. Additionally, we compare the performance of our LSTM model
performance with a Multilayered Perceptron with a time window using as variables autoregressive terms of our
dataset. We conclude that the performed accuracy is impressive
nevertheless it might be attributed to the good fitting of the model in the
out of sample data and lack of exposure to LSTM of the particular
market. Finally, we suggest ideas for further research.

Keywords: Algorithmic Trading, Efficient Market Hypothesis, Artificial
Neural Networks.
